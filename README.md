Economic_analysis 


We aim to analyse various metrics and KPIs related to economic factors and see how they change due to covid. 

There are various lines one could explore, the initial ideas we have are the following: 

1) See how the stock market indices change w.r.t pandemanics - so we have used some historical data for that
2) How the impact of globalisation effects the impulse of economies due to covid (we use national GDP's and their correlations as a metric for this in our first attemp)
3) Look for mathematical consistencies between impulse of stocks (or other economic factors) and epidemeological models such as the SAR model etc. 

These are just a few initial things we are exploring - of course we are open to ideas and see what would be useful things to work on.
