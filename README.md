Economic_analysis 

We aim to analyze various metrics and KPIs related to economic factors and see how they change due to covid.

There are various lines one could explore, the initial ideas we have are the following:

See how the stock market indices change w.r.t pandemics - so we have used some historical data for that

How the impact of globalization effects the impulse of economies due to covid (we use national GDP's and their correlations as a metric for this in our first attempt)

Look for mathematical consistencies between impulse of stocks (or other economic factors) and epidemiological models such as the SAR model etc.

Sentiment analysis to gauge how the public is responding to the outbreak and then relate that to how we think the public's sentiment effects the economy

These are just a few initial things we are exploring - of course we are open to ideas and see what would be useful things to work on.
