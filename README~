The aim of this project is to ask the basic questions about how covid-19 is impacting the world, now and in the future. We aim to collect and analyse data to address specific questions about the world and how it is effected. 

To do list

- Come up with a list of basic questions that we wish to pursue and are the most important to quantify covid-19's impact. 
- Figure out what data we would need to answer those questions and how we get it
- Analyse the data and report findings
- Infer the most important lessons from this so we know how to prepare for the future
